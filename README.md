App Projects for Shumaker Developments

Each App Project should have a new folder initialized for the project. If project title is multiple words, separate with dashes.

How-To Create Folders:
  Click Add New File in Git Repo
  Type File Name plus add /new (this will create the folder along with a blank file "new"
  Once the App is created in VSCode and uploaded to the desired folder, delete the new file
